**This Data Application Focuses on three main aspects:**
- Web scraper collect the data based on the desired year of the user and the position or "phase of the game".
- The data visualization of the data scraped. The visualizations are in the form of a radar chart, which depicts how well a player performed in a given selected season.
  *Note: This only applies if the player qualified for rankings.*
- The ranking of the players of the selected season based on an equation that I came up with to compare a set of players based on the following categories: Passing, Rushing, Receiving.
